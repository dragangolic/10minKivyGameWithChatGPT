# 10minKivyGameWithChatGPT
Using ChatGPT and my favorite Kivy (Python Framework). In 10 min me and my assistant build this game. :)

Now the entire game is fully modular and OOP, with:

config.py → all constants.

entities/ → all objects separated.

hud.py → display logic.

game.py → main controller.

main.py → entry point.
